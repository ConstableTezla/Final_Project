                   Looks aside the new Xbox is showing to be the most powerful console to date even out performing the PS5. The release date is vage being holliday 2020. What this most likely means is some time in october just in time for christmas shopping. The PS5 is following suit with the same relase scheldule as the Xbox Series X.

                   I mentioned that this will be the most powerful console to date so lets look at some of the specs. The Xbox Series X is said to have an 8-core AMD Zen 2 processer, 12 teraflop AMD RDNA 2 GPU, 16 gigs of DDR6 ram, and base 1T of solid state storage. What all of that means in laymans terms is that this console will be more powerful than some 2-3 thousand dollar computers. You can have that kind of power for a base price of $499.
