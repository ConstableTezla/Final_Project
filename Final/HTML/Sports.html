                    Due to the COVID-19 outbreak the biggest disc golf event in the state of Kansas, the Glass Blown Open, had to be cancelled. Ametures and pros alike were all disapointed but understanding on the current events. In responce to this the GBO went online. While this was not the usual tournement we are all used to, there was a pannel on pros to give advice to those who wanted it. So everyone from <a href= "https://www.latitude64.se/team-64/" target= "_blank"> Team Latitude </a> still got their chance to connect to the comunity.

                    Even tho the tournement was cancelled people still payed money to play. Part of this price goes to the player packs; goodie bags given to the first few hundred people who sign up. These packs were sent out to everyone regardless of if they signed up in time or not to make up for it. The virtual tournement showed a fly over of the course to be played as well as live Q/A's with unboxings of the player packs. The PDGA will have to keep delaying or cancelleing tournements as long as the large gathering bans are still in play, but they have backup plans much like what we saw with the GBO to keep players happy.
